# WirlessControledRobot
The code here is for a UWP C# application used to drive the robot which was presented on cedat open day 2017.
This robot was written about by the new vision at the link http://bit.ly/2oCxsPw 
The hardware consists of the HC-06 module which was used for communication between the arduino and the Computer running the application
The Arduino code was the Standard Firmata firmware and Microsoft's Windows Remode Arduino C# library was used in the UWP program to interface with firmata.
this task was accomplished in 3 days. it is not so perfect.
The schematic of the hardware without including the servo motor is shown below in proteus
